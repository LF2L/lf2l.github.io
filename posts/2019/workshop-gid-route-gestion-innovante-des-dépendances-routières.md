# Highlights

• We proposed an air quality evaluation framework using fixed and mobile sensing units. 

• It also integrates machine learning methods to predict the air quality from mobile data. 

• Three experimenting protocols for air pollution monitoring have been implemented. 

• NO2 pollution at human breathing levels was 3-5 times higher than those of static units. 

• Decision trees and neural networks can accurately predict mobile air quality. 

• Humidity and noise are the most important factors affecting the NO2 prediction.
