# Feedback on the "Energy and territory" training week at ENSGSI #
Published, 2020-12-07 on [http://factuel.univ-lorraine.fr/node/15749](http://factuel.univ-lorraine.fr/node/15749)

**From November 16 to 20, 2020, a week of "Energy and Territory" workshop took place for the second year in a row as part of the Master 2 Urban Planning and Planning, course [Innovation Urbaine pour des villes et territoires en transformation (IUVTT) of l’École nationale supérieure en génie des systèmes et de l’innovation (ENSGSI)](https://www.ensgsi.univ-lorraine.fr/formations/masters/IUVTT/).**

Twenty-four students (engineering students, town planners, architects, sociologists, community agents, continuing education professionals) benefited from the synergy between the [European Smagrinet project](https://www.smagrinet.eu) (EU Grant agreement 837626) a skills hub on smart grids to stimulate research, innovation and training for the energy transition involving laboratories [GREEN](https://green.univ-lorraine.fr/) and [ERPI](https://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr/fr/)) and the [IMPACT ULHyS project, (Université de Lorraine Hydrogène, science et technologies)](http://lue.univ-lorraine.fr/fr/article/impact-ulhys) de Lorraine Université d’Excellence (LUE), axis Multi-objective optimization of multi-vector energy systems in laboratories [LRGP](https://lrgp-nancy.cnrs.fr/) and ERPI.

# Energy, a territorial challenge #

Starting from a real case, this workshop confronts students with the current challenges of the energy transition facing territories and companies (energy sector). Through a detailed analysis of the ecosystem and the needs of the players in a territory, the project consists of co-designing and evaluating the potential acceptability of different scenarios for the deployment of distributed energy systems involving production and / or storage solutions. of hydrogen. To support them, participants have access to the most recent research work on hydrogen, smart grids, co-design or even shared decision-making and discussions directly with experts.

The students, new to energy issues and smart grids, benefited this year from the [training program on Smart Grids](https://www.smagrinet.eu/power-on/powerful-services/smart-grid-from-a-to-z-programs/) intended for manufacturers, the general public and public decision-makers, [posted online in October 2020 after a year and a half of work](https://www.smagrinet.eu/newsflash/blog/-e2-80-9csmart-grid-from-a-to-z-e2-80-9d-programs-are-launched/). 
These courses, accessible free of charge (for the moment in English), are developed by the GREEN and ERPI laboratories as part of [Smagrinet](https://www.smagrinet.eu/).

# Participatory science, a lever for research on energy transition. #

The challenge for researchers from complementary disciplines is to combine their knowledge and know-how to innovate together in order to train the specialists and professionals of tomorrow while integrating the point of view of users / citizens and public decision-makers.

The involvement of researchers in educational workshops enables the students of the University of Lorraine to benefit from the resources of our laboratories as soon as possible.

Conversely, the researchers have feedback on the modalities of leading a participatory science approach face-to-face and online. These meetings also make it possible to detect possible scientific controversies on socio-technical systems by listening to the criticisms and remarks of the participants. The next step is to offer these workshops directly to citizens, users, businesses, communities. In this sense, the Smagrinet team has been involved, for example, since 2019 in the Club Smart Grid du Grand Est to involve local businesses. She also produced a first design analysis by use (Living Lab) of smart grid modules ([see conference paper](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICE/ITMC49519.2020.9198604)) by increasing the number of workshops with different university training: EDUTER university degree (Economy and sustainable land use planning) and Ingexys IDEAS master's degree (Innovation and design evaluated by use).

# An innovative educational device # 

Initially experienced on the co-design platform [LF2L](http://lf2l.fr/) (Lorraine Fab Living Lab®) to combine training via MOOC and active pedagogy on a model and immersive devices, government decisions have required to adapt practices. For this new edition, the teaching team and researchers have transformed the workshop into a week of online interaction, reinforcing the ability to support and associate at a distance.

The students were able to follow, on November 19, 2020, the [1st international conference of the European project SMAGRINET “Energy Game Changers”](https://www.smagrinet.eu/newsflash/events/energy-game-changers-2020-powered-by-smagrinet/), whose final round table benefited from the testimony of Fabrice Lemoine, “Energies for the future” coordinator of LUE. This exceptional meeting of academic, industrial and institutional experts (European Commission) around energy issues and smart grids made it possible to compare the views of stakeholders and open up many avenues of investigation and action to engage Europe. in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, notably through an overhaul of its networks and practices in terms of energy production, distribution and consumption.
