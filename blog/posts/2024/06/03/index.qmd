From May 21 to 24, 2024, the Lorraine Fab Living Lab welcomed a delegation of 14 teachers and professionals from the University of Santiago de Chile (USACH) for the closing of the CLIP program launched in November 2023. 


The aim of this project, led by ENSGSI, was to support the USACH teams in staffing their future teaching and research support platform. 

  
During the four-day seminar, the participants' program was as follows: 
On the first day, after being welcomed by the two project leaders, Mauricio Camargo, director of ERPI, and Ferney Osorio, teacher-researcher at ENSGSI, the USACH team took part in an introductory creativity workshop led by Raphaël Bary, lecturer at ENSGSI. 

On the second day, under the guidance of Mauricio Camargo, the Chilean delegation visited other Université de Lorraine institutions, including the GEORESSOURCES laboratory, the École des Mines, 2LPN, GreenFabLab, PeeLab Nancy and BETA. They then visited the premises of the school's long-standing industrial partner, NOREMAT, in Ludres. 

On the third day, they took part in a second workshop on the introduction to prototyping, coordinated by Fabio Cruz, lecturer, and Alex Gabriel, teacher-researcher, both at ENSGSI. 

Finally, on the last day, they attended a workshop on thinking about action plans for innovation spaces, led by Ferney Osorio. 

At the end of the last day of the seminar, the members of the Chilean team received a certificate attesting to their participation in the program, and were invited by ENSGSI and ERPI to a cocktail party to celebrate the beginnings of a new partnership between the University of Lorraine and USACH. 


El equipo del Lorraine Fab Living Lab estuvo encantado de recibirlos para este maravilloso evento, y esperamos continuar esta colaboración a largo plazo!
