As part of the partnership between the Ecole Nationale Supérieure en Génie des Systèmes et de l'Innovation (ENSGSI) / l'ERPI | Equipe de Recherche sur les Processus Innovatifs and GRTgaz, a test bench was designed and built by Benjamin Ennesser-Serville at the Green Fab Lab (an LF2L initiative) to reproduce real working conditions for operators. This use-based evaluation device enabled 2nd-year engineering students at ENSGSI to test their various prototypes as part of the Iterative Design and Evaluation module.

This project, along with the students' prototypes, will be presented at the module's defense on Thursday April 11, 2024, starting at 1:45 pm at ENSGSI.

LF2L would like to thank L'Octroi-Nancy for making our actions possible, Alaa Hassan, Senior Lecturer at ENSGSI, as well as Sébastien Bourgeois, Sylvain Poulain, Philippe Mannoni and Joel Wagner from GRT gaz for this mission.
