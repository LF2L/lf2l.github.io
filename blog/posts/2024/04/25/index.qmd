Discover the **Lorraine Fab Living Lab® (LF2L)**, a member of the federation of innovation spaces under the Sirius program. 
This space, supported by ENSGSI and the ERPI laboratory, is positioned as a platform for the acceptability of innovations and the prospective evaluation of uses.

Factuel spoke to Laure Morel, Director of ENSGSI, Mauricio Camargo, Director of ERPI, and Laurent Dupont, Scientific Director of LF2L, to find out more about this innovation space.

## Can you tell us who LF2L is?

Celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, LF2L confirms its recognition as a major player in the Grand Est region's innovative ecosystem. Supported from the outset by the Université de Lorraine, the region, the Greater Nancy metropolitan area, industrial groups, local authorities, SME-SMI networks and associations, the LF2L is a place that mobilizes all players through a continuum of 2D-3D-4D innovation at the service of sustainable development.

## What are the main activities of your innovation space?
Within the Lorraine Fab Living Lab, various activities stimulate innovation and creativity. The creation and use of "demonstrators" of new products, processes, services and organizations are encouraged, mobilizing companies, local players, citizens and academics around common issues. It offers an open, functional space for prototyping, at the crossroads of open innovation, collective creativity, the Living Lab and the FabLab. The experiments carried out are based on collaborative approaches, involving users in the design and development of concrete solutions for the territories of the future.


## Do you have an outstanding project to share?
The creation of a local plastic recycling industry, based on additive manufacturing or injection molding, is opening up new opportunities for the circular economy. This project, the [Green FabLab](/projects/green-fablab/), is experimenting with the principles of the circular and collaborative economy, integrating plastic waste as a new raw material.

This demonstrator illustrates LF2L's ability to develop innovative responses to the social and environmental challenges of today and tomorrow.
