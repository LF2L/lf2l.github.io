After being tested by engineering students from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure en Génie des Systèmes et de l'Innovation (ENSGSI), and presented to the university community at a theme day last February, the general public had the opportunity to discover the HELP XR training design tool.  

 

This tool, supported by the Université de Lorraine and the Région Grand Est, and tested on the LF2L premises, aims to simplify the work of instructors in preparing extended reality training courses. The original idea behind this tool, developed by ERPI | Equipe de Recherche sur les Processus Innovatifs and ENSGSI, is to create training courses that are simultaneously available in virtual reality, augmented reality and 3D on a web browser. 

Thanks to an invitation from Isabelle Chabanon-Pouget, head of digital culture projects, Alex Gabriel, researcher at ERPI and lecturer at ENSGSI, was able to present HELP XR during Immersive Technologies Month at the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie. 

The dozen or so people who took part in the demonstration were able to use augmented reality to learn how to use a laser cutting machine available at the Carrefour du Numérique² at the Cité des Sciences. 


This participation illustrates the growing interest in immersive technologies and their integration into ENSGSI's training courses. A Master 2 IDEAS group had already paved the way for collaboration with Universcience, parent company of the Cité des Sciences, with a Design Thinking project on the theme of virtual reality. 

To discover the tool, we invite you to come and see us at the Forum - L'odysée PLEIADES on March 22, 2024, or to contact Alex Gabriel.
