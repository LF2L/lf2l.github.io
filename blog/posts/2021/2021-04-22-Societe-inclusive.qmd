In view of the first calls for projects of the new **R&I Horizon Europe framework program** announced for this spring, take part in the information sequence on opportunities and expectations in the social and human sciences.  

In addition to methodological advice and experience sharing, this session will allow you to discover the conditions of participation, the strategic orientations of cluster 2 **"Culture, creativity and inclusive society"** of pillar 2 of the program, but also the main lines of the calendar. and the expected impacts for the projects to be carried out.  

This cluster aims to **respond to the challenges facing our contemporary societies**, whether **economic, political, social or cultural**. In addition, this cluster aims to demonstrate that European projects are intended to finance research, but beyond the expected scientific output, they must also propose, or even test, concrete solutions. The projects financed must give an important place to the involvement of other stakeholders (for example agents in charge of the implementation of public policies, decision-makers, social workers, companies designing the technical or technological solutions proposed).  

Come and ask all your questions during this sequence which will allow you to better define these themes contributing to the **development of an inclusive and sustainable growth model** by focusing on three main areas of intervention for the calls for projects to come: democracy and governance , cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries, economic and social transformations.  

With the interventions of:

**Mr. Laurent Dupont**, Research Engineer at the ERPI Laboratory (Research Team on Innovative Processes) of the National School of Systems and Innovation Engineering, at the University of Lorraine, Coordinator of the collaborative project INEDIT (open INnovation Ecosystems for Do It Together process) funded by Horizon 2020  

**Mr. Basudeb Chaudhuri**, Representative on Program Committees, Head of Mission for the Humanities and Social Sciences sector, at the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation  

**Mr. Jean-Jacques Bernardini**, Head of European Affairs Department of the Grand E-Nov + Innovation and International Prospecting Agency, for the DIGIT RRI project
