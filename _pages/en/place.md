# Our space at the LF2L

## The LF2L, one of the innovation labs listed by the MESR

![](https://inspiration.dgesip.fr/images/MESR_web.svg){: width="250" }

In 2023, the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research has set up a platform to list inspiring locations. 
LF2L is one of them! 
It even has the status of 21 out of 277 innovation locations in December 2023. 
FFind out more about the spaces and the associated educational, research and development activities on [the ministry's website](https://inspiration.dgesip.fr/Espaces/Lieu/WuMr6/)

## LF2L, an ICEEL Carnot Institute platform referenced on Plug In Labs Lorraine

Plug In Labs offers centralised access to all the skills and equipment available in public research in Lorraine.
Find out more about all the equipment and services offered by ERPI with its LF2L platform on [the Plug In Labs Lorraine website](https://pluginlabs.univ-lorraine.fr/fr/entity/f7cb6674-7cc0-41ea-9fe1-e777ea57a78d/lorraine-fab-living-lab)


## Immersive space

![communities at lf2l]({{ site.baseurl | append: page.img-path | append:'lf2l-1.jpg' }}){: .align-right}
This technology is available to users and its role is to compensate for the impossibility of carrying out a site visit (industrial or urban) or to remind a working group of certain spatial or urban arrangements already visited. We are deliberately inspired here by simulators or video games by simplifying the user interface as much as possible: no obstacles for the participant, simple hand or leg movements allow a virtual walk to complete a diagnosis of use or the projection of future solutions.


## Creativity and Open Innovation

![communities at lf2l]({{ site.baseurl | append: page.img-path | append:'lf2l-2.jpg' }}){: .align-right}
When a problem is defined, group facilitation work will make it possible to solicit the creativity of a team around brainstorming, road-mapping, in order to cover the field of possibilities in terms of answers to be provided. In addition, an Internet platform has been developed (PRINCIP Chair) to help capitalize and archive proposals submitted by participants (a creativity session that can bring together up to 400 people).


## Project Group Space

![communities at lf2l]({{ site.baseurl | append: page.img-path | append:'lf2l-3.jpg' }}){: .align-right}
The space is designed to generate an environment dedicated to collaborative work. We can therefore welcome several project groups, citizen panels or communities of practice to enable them to work on a specific issue or enrich the open innovation approach initiated by creativity.


## Digital Ideas Sheet - 2D Sorting

![communities at lf2l]({{ site.baseurl | append: page.img-path | append:'lf2l-4.jpg' }}){: .align-right}
The digitisation of the idea sheets and their availability on a touch table makes it possible to increase their manipulation, interaction and exchange between participants.


## Innovation capability

![communities at lf2l]({{ site.baseurl | append: page.img-path | append:'lf2l-5.jpg' }}){: .align-right}
The ERPI laboratory provides a tool to assess the capacity of SMEs to innovate and to support the strategy to be adopted to develop an innovative product, project or process. The result of 4 years of research, this software is supported by a digital platform www.innovation-on-the-web.com which makes the diagnostic process easily accessible for companies.

## 3D numerical modeling

###  Product Model

![communities at lf2l]({{ site.baseurl | append: page.img-path | append:'lf2l-6.jpg' }}){: .align-center}
Pre-prototype modeling based on CAD (Computer Aided Design) tools

### City numerical model

{% include video id="wSphexsNeEw" provider="youtube" %}

3D modeling of traffic flows (example of intersections C129, C201, C100 a, C100 b of the EcoQuartier Nancy Grand CÅ“ur)


## Materialization / Fablab space

![communities at lf2l]({{ site.baseurl | append: page.img-path | append:'lf2l-7.jpg' }}){: .align-right}
The materialization of ideas, a key element in the Innovation process. And for that, one of the particularities of the LF2L is to have a Fab Lab space fully equipped with digital tools that will allow all our users to make the manufacture of objects accessible in a personalized way. In addition, the ERPI laboratory develops research programs around the FabLab concept and its impact on current societal issues. Fab Lab (contraction of the English Fabrication Laboratory "manufacturing laboratory") makes it possible to invent / innovate / reproduce through four basic equipment: Laser cutting, 3D printers, digital milling machine, vinyl cutting


## Usage Evaluation

![communities at lf2l]({{ site.baseurl | append: page.img-path | append:'lf2l-8.jpg' }}){: .align-center}

Usage evaluation consists in creating the conditions for the scientific objectification of usage practices among a group of users. Depending on the object, product, building or space to be evaluated, we can set up ad hoc processes using the appropriate measuring instruments (e. g. eyes tracking, physiological sensors, video recording, surveys, etc.)
