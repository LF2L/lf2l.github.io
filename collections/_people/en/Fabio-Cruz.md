I'm research associate at the ERPI Laboratory.

I work specifically at the research platform Lorraine Fab Living Lab([http://lf2l.fr/](http://lf2l.fr/ "http://lf2l.fr/")) in subjects related to the 3D printing process.

I'm graduated in Mechanical Engineering from the National University of Colombia([http://unal.edu.co/](http://unal.edu.co/ "http://unal.edu.co/")), master in Innovation management from the ENSGSI([https://www.ensgsi.univ-lorraine.fr/](https://www.ensgsi.univ-lorraine.fr/ "https://www.ensgsi.univ-lorraine.fr/")) school and PhD in Industrial Engineering from the Universit√© de Lorraine.

The research that I have developed so far is focused on the conceptualization of a circular economy through a distributed polymer recycling approach for the open source 3D printing technology.

Technical and logistical characterizations are studied in the validation of each aspect of the distributed and local recycling process for this technology.
