## Competences for Social Innovation Lab Teams


The creation of Social Innovation Labs needs competencies in order to manage differet type of task around the work of a lab.

Multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity teams is an ideally setup.
People that have work experience in several sectors (public administration, private, not-for-profit etc.) and different policy fields (education, labour, health etc.). 
In doing so,  the lab itself involves practitioners with diverse perspectives on societal challenges. 
Furthermore, this mix of team members generates a multitude of key competencies that effective lab-processes rely on:


# Goal

> Make an initial competences cartography in order to assest the evolution of the creation of the labs. 



# Methodology

# Expected results

- Profil for each LA partner university.
- Identification of competences that are missing.
